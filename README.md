### Dataset
The file wdbc.pkl  Download wdbc.pklcontains a dataset of patients tested for breast cancer using a fine needle aspirate (FNA). Each patient is represented by statistics of 10 different features of multiple cell samples, as well as a diagnosis (malignant or benign). For definitions of these variables, see [Breast Cancer](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) Dataset. The file wdbc.pkl  Download wdbc.pklhas columns in the order: subject id, label, features. Clarification: The three different features for each variable, with suffixes "_0", "_1", "_2" represent the mean, standard deviation and "worst" value over a set of samples, respectively. Please see the ["Data description"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.names) for a precise definition.
