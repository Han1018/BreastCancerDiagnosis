# BreastCancerDiagnosis
### 概論
此專案中我們針對細針抽吸（fine needle aspirate)乳腺癌檢測的患者數據集，建立一預測模型。資料集的來源是開放資料集![乳腺癌數據集](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))每個患者由多個細胞樣本的 10 個不同特徵的統計數據以及診斷（惡性或良性）表示


### Dataset
The file wdbc.pkl  Download wdbc.pklcontains a dataset of patients tested for breast cancer using a fine needle aspirate (FNA). Each patient is represented by statistics of 10 different features of multiple cell samples, as well as a diagnosis (malignant or benign). For definitions of these variables, see [Breast Cancer](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) Dataset. The file wdbc.pkl  Download wdbc.pklhas columns in the order: subject id, label, features. Clarification: The three different features for each variable, with suffixes "_0", "_1", "_2" represent the mean, standard deviation and "worst" value over a set of samples, respectively. Please see the ["Data description"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.names) for a precise definition.
